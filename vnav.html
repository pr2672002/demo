            Household hazardous waste or HHW include three sub-categories – E-waste; toxic substances such as paints,
            cleaning agents, solvents, insecticides and their containers, other chemicals; and biomedical waste.

          <button class="question">What are ways of storing the waste at homes?</button>
          <div class="answer">1.Dry waste

            Store it in a bag in the utility area after cleaning and drying till it is picked up. No food residue must
            be left in the bottles and packets. Clean them as you would to reuse them. If clothes are totally unusable,
            or very damaged, they are categorized as dry waste. If clothes are soiled with body fluids, they become
            sanitary waste. If they are soiled with paint, or any chemicals, they are HHW (household hazardous waste).

            2. E-waste

            Store them in separate container which is kept closed, away from moisture and in which nothing else is put.
